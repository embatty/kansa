# Member Services API

All API requests need to be made using secure connections, i.e. with `https` or
`wss` protocols, and their paths should be prefixed by `/api/`. Requests for
`/api/hugo/...` will be handled by the [`hugo`](../hugo/) server,
`/api/raami/...` by [`raami`](../raami/), and all others by [`kansa`](../kansa/).

Some GET paths include query parameters. POST body parameters may be included
either as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` or as `application/json`. All
server responses will be formatted as JSON.

In cases of error, the HTTP status code will be `400` or `401` for client error,
and `500` for server error. The response should contain a `status` field with
the contents `"error"` or `"unauthorized"`, as appropriate, possibly along with
some relevant data and/or a `message` field.

## Public information

### `GET public/people`

- Parameters: `csv`

List of members who have opted to have their info in public. If the query
parameter `csv` is true-ish, returns results as csv rather than json format.

#### Response

```
[
  { country, membership, first_name, last_name },
  …
]
```

### `GET public/stats`

- Parameters: `csv`

Membership statistics by country. If the query parameter `csv` is true-ish,
returns results as csv rather than json format.

#### Response

```
{
  Finland: { Adult: 13, …, total: 26 },
  …,
  '': { Adult: 131, …, total: 262 }
}
```

### `GET config`

The configuration used by this instance.

#### Response

```
{
  id: 'w75',
  name: 'Worldcon 75',
  paid_paper_pubs: true,
  membershipTypes: {
    Adult: {
      badge: true,
      hugo_nominator: true,
      member: true,
      wsfs_member: true
    },
    ...
  }
}
```

## Authentication

### `POST key`

- Parameters: `email`, `name`, `path`, `reset`

If `email` matches (case-insensitively) a known address, send a login link to
that address. If no key exists or `reset` is true-ish, generate a new key. If
no match is found for `email` and `name` is set, create a new non-member account
and login key, and send a login link to `email`. If `path` is set, it will be
included in the login link as the value of the `next` query parameter.

#### Response

```
{
  status: 'success',
  email: 'address@example.com'
}
```

### `GET/POST login`

- Parameters: `email`, `key`

Fails with HTTP status `400` for missing input values, `401` for incorrect
`email`/`key` combinations, and `403` for expired `key` (which triggers a key
reset and sends an email with an updated login link). Creates a new session
object for valid credentials.

#### Response

```
Set-Cookie: w75=sessionId

{
  status: 'success',
  email
}
```

### `GET/POST logout`

- Requires authentication
- Parameters: `all`, `reset`, `email` (`admin_admin` only)

Removes the user information from the current session. If `email` is set in the
parameters, the session user needs `admin_admin` authority; otherwise it's read
from session data. If `all` is set, all of the user's sessions are terminated.
If `reset` is set, the user's key is also reset, and will need to be
re-requested.

#### Response

```
{
  status: 'success',
  email,
  opt: undefined | 'all' | 'reset',
  sessions: undefined | #
}
```

## User info

### `GET user`

- Requires authentication
- Parameters: `email` (`member_admin` only)

If `email` is not set, its value is read from session data. Returns the
memberships matching the given email address, and the roles (e.g.
`"member_admin"`) assigned to this email address.

#### Response

```
{
  email,
  people: [ { id, membership, legal_name, … }, … ],
  roles: [ … ]
}
```

### `GET user/log`

- Requires authentication
- Parameters: `email` (`member_admin` only)

If `email` is not set, its value is read from session data. Returns the
log entries with `author` set to the given email address.

#### Response

```
{
  email,
  log: [ … ]
}
```

## Member info

### `GET people`

- Requires authentication and `member_admin` or `member_list` authority
- Parameters: `since`, `name`, and all person fields

List member data. If no query parameters are present, the response array
contains all members and is padded with `null` values such that
`response[id].id == id`, and fields with `null` or `false` values are left out
of the response.

`since` will return entries with a `last_modified` value (ISO 8601 date) greater
than specified. `name` is shorthand for searching among all three name fields.
All text fields are compared using the postgres case-insensitive `ILIKE`, which
uses `_` for single-character wildcards and `%` for multiple characters.

#### Response

```
[
  { id, last_modified, member_number, legal_name, email, … },
  …
]
```

### `POST people`

- Requires authentication and `member_admin` authority
- Parameters: `membership`, `legal_name`, `email`, `public_first_name`,
  `public_last_name`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `paper_pubs`

Add new person. If `membership` is not `'NonMember'`, a new `member_number` will
be generated.

#### Response

```
{
  status: 'success',
  id,
  member_number
}
```

### `GET people/:id`

- Requires authentication

Find the person matching `id`. If its email address does not match the session
data, `member_admin` or `member_list` authority is required.

#### Response

```
{
  id, last_modified, member_number, membership, legal_name, email,
  public_first_name, public_last_name, city, state, country,
  paper_pubs: { name, address, country },
  preferred_name, daypass, daypass_days
}
```

### `GET people/:id/log`

- Requires authentication

Find the log entries for the person matching `id`. If its email address does not
match the session data, `member_admin` or `member_list` authority is required.

#### Response

```
[
  { timestamp: …, author: …, subject: …, action: …, … },
  …
]
```

### `POST people/:id`

- Requires authentication
- Parameters: `membership` (`member_admin` only), `email` (`member_admin` only),
  `legal_name`, `public_first_name`, `public_last_name`, `city`, `state`,
  `country`, `paper_pubs`

Update the data for the person matching `id`. If its email address does not
match the session data, `member_admin` authority is required.

If set, the `paper_pubs` value is required to be a JSON object with non-empty
values for the fields `name`, `address`, and `country`. If the user does not
`member_admin` authority, it also needs to have been previously set to a
non-null value.

#### Response

```
{
  status: 'success',
  updated: [ 'legal_name', … ]
}
```

### `POST people/:id/upgrade`

- Requires authentication and `member_admin` authority
- Parameters: `membership`, `member_number` (`admin_admin` only), `paper_pubs`

Increase membership level, generating a `member_number` if not set in parameters
or previously set. Also handles `paper_pubs` purchases, connected or separately
from membership changes.

#### Response

```
{
  status: 'success',
  member_number,
  updated: [ 'membership', 'member_number', 'paper_pubs' ]
}
```

### `POST people/lookup`

- Parameters: `email`, `member_number`, `name`

Finds a person's `id`, `membership` and `name` based on a slightly fuzzy lookup
given some subset of the parameters `email`, `member_number`, and `name`. If the
lookup matches more than one hit, `status` will be `multiple`. If no matches are
found, `status` will be `not found`. Child and Kid-in-tow members are not
included in the results.

#### Response

```
{
  status: 'success',
	id,
  membership,
  name
}
```

### WebSocket: `people/updates`

- Requires authentication and `member_admin` authority

WebSocket connection endpoint. The server won't listen to any messages sent to
it, but will broadcast updates to People as they happen. Each message will
contain as its data a JSON string representation of a single updated person.

The API uses the app-specific codes `4001` and `4004` on WebSocket `'close'`
events to signal `'Unauthorized'` and `'Not Found'` (respectively) to the client.

#### Response

```
'{"id":#,"member_number":…,"legal_name":…,…}'
```

## Purchases

### `POST purchase`

- Parameters: `account`, `amount`, `email`, `source`,
  `new_members: [ { membership, email, legal_name, public_first_name, public_last_name, city, state, country, paper_pubs }, ... ]`,
  `upgrades: [ { id, membership, paper_pubs }, ... ]`

Using the `source` (or token) object received from Stripe, make a charge of
`amount` on the card (once verified against the server-side calculated sum from
the items) and add the `new_members` to the database as well as applying the
specified `upgrades`. For new members, generate a login key and include it in
the welcome email sent to each address. Sends an info message to each new or
upgraded member.

#### Response

```
{
  status: 'success',
  charge_id
}
```

### `GET purchase/data`

Current purchase data for non-membership purchases. Top-level keys correspond to
pre-defined payment categories and their `types`. `shape` values define the
shapes of the expected `data` object, with matching JS `type`. Shape values with
`required: true` need to have a non-empty value in the matching request.

#### Response

```
{
  new_member: {
    label: 'New membership',
    allow_create_account: true,
    shape: [
      {
        key: membership,
        type: string,
        label: 'Membership type'
      },
      ...
    ],
    types: [
      {
        key: 'Adult',
        label: 'Adult',
        amount: 19500
      },
      ...
    ]
  },
  sponsor: {
    label: 'Sponsorship',
    listed: true,
    description: 'Why not sponsor ...',
    shape: [
      {
        key: 'sponsor',
        type: 'string',
        label: 'Sponsor name',
        required: true
      },
      ...
    ],
    types: [
      {
        key: 'bench',
        label: 'Sponsored bench plaque',
        amount: 6000,
        description: '<p>Fannish Tradition ....</p>'
      },
      ...
    ]
  },
  ...
}
```

### `GET purchase/keys`

Current public Stripe keys. Includes at least the `default` key. If a non-default
key is used, its name should be passed to `POST` purchase calls as the value of
`account`.

#### Response

```
{
  default: 'pk_test_...',
  ...
}
```

### `GET purchase/list`

Purchases made using this account's `email` address, or one set as a query
parameter (requires `member_admin` access).

#### Response

```
